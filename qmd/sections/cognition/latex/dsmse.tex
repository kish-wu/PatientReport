\subsection{Down Syndrome Mental Status Exam (DSMSE)}

The Down Syndrome Mental State Exam is a cognitive assessment we administer at
each visit. It is designed to evaluate an individual’s current mental
functioning. 

While lower percentile scores are generally interpreted as indicating lower
cognitive ability, these scores do not take into consideration level of
intellectual functioning and other important clinical factors including medical
history. Please note, we generally look for change over time to help indicate
whether a change in cognitive status is happening. 

Below is a brief description of what categories the DSMSE test evaluates.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Visual-Spatial} refers to the skill to be able to interpret what we see and where we are. 
    \item \textbf{Memory} refers to the ability to remember information, people, or experiences
    \item \textbf{Language} refers to the use of words in order to share information or communicate with others. 
    
\end{enumerate}
