\subsection{Your Brain Amyloid PET Scan}

Researchers and clinicians can use positron emission tomography (PET) to measure your
brain amyloid level in something called centiloids. Centiloids are a unit of measurement
ranging from 0 to 100. Everyone has some amyloid in their brain, but having high levels
means you have a high risk of developing memory changes. In individuals with Down
syndrome a centiloid value of 18 or higher is considered high, meaning someone has a
higher risk of developing memory changes.

These pictures are not your PET scan, these are examples of people with different levels
of amyloid in their brain. The red areas show the most amyloid close together, and yellow
is amyloid spread out.

Your centiloid value is: {{centiloid}}

Your Amyloid PET scan results showed that your amyloid level is {{amyloidHigh}}.

\textbf{What do my results mean?}

Taken together with your memory and thinking tests, this means:
