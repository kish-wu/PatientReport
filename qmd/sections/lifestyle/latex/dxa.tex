This scan helps determine your body composition which includes levels of body
fat, lean tissue (muscles and organs), and bone density. Your body composition
is affected by age, gender, genetics, physical fitness, and diet. A higher
amount of lean tissue and a lower amount of fat tissue can help you not get sick
as often. The best way to improve your lean tissue is through healthy eating and
regular exercise.
