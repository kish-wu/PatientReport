\subsection{Body Mass Index}

BMI is a standard measure of healthy body weight based on your height. A healthy
BMI is anywhere between 18.5 and 24.9. If your BMI is too high or too low, it
can increase your risk for some diseases. Maintaining a healthy weight with a
healthy diet and exercise can bring your number into a healthy range and reduce
your risk for diseases like diabetes, heart disease stroke and dementia.
